# Better Markdown

## What is Better Markdown?
Better Markdown is a version of Markdown that I made. Its purpose is to make Markdown easier to use 
and to fix the issues that I personally have with it. The main issues I wanted to address when making 
Better Markdown was that in regular Markdown you would have to type \#\#\#\#\#\# to make text be a header 
six. If you wanted to make something bold, you would have to type in \*\*, two asterisks. I thought that 
that was too much to type out everytime, so I decided to make my own version where you get to type out less 
(Better Markdown). (Those examples in Better Markdown would be: 6\# and / respectively.)

## How to Use It
Create a text file and type in the text you want in Better Markdown. Run the 'markup.py' file. The 'markup.py' 
file will ask you to enter the name of your text file into it, and then it will give you your output in regular 
Markdown which you can then use.
